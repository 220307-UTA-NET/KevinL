-- this is SQL
-- for comments

-- when nothing is highlighted, and we run/execute everything in the current query is run
-- you can select only a specific command, and only run that one

SELECT * FROM Customer;
-- when you make a query to a DB, any result will take the form of a table

SELECT 'Hello World';
-- single quotes mark a string literal

SELECT 2 + 2;

SELECT SYSUTCDATETIME();

-- USUALLY nothing in SQL is case sensitive
select 2 + 2;

-- semicolons are not a required end-line character. they are an end of operation/end of thought. and are not generally required.
SELECT 2 + 2


SELECT Address FROM Customer;
-- SELECT (Columns) FROM (Table)
--          ^ select-list


-- Column Alias 
-- great for concatenating multiple columns together.
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName, Address FROM Customer;
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS FullName, Address FROM Customer;
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS 'FullName', Address FROM Customer;
SELECT FirstName + ' ' + LastName AS [FullName], Address FROM Customer;


-- filtering with WHERE

SELECT * -- get this column
FROM Customer -- from this table

--all rock songs, showing the name in the format "Artist-Name - Song-Name"

-- genre has genre name and genre ID
-- track has track name, genre id, and album id
-- Album has id and artist id
-- artist has artist name and artist id

SELECT Artist.Name  + ' - ' + Track.Name AS [Artist - Song]
-- SELECT Artist.Name AS [Artist], Track.Name AS [Artist - Song]
FROM Track 
    INNER JOIN Genre ON Genre.GenreID = Track.GenreID-- genre has genre name and genre ID

-- Set operations
-- Set oerations let us run multiple queries as a single query

-- all first names of employees and customers
SELECT FirstName FROM Employee
UNION 
SELECT FirstName FROM Customer;
-- UNION returns all entries that are found on either query, without duplicates.
-- UNION ALL '', with duplicates(a little faster, but could have more results)

-- names that are both a customer and an employee
SELECT FirstName FROM Employee
INTERSECT
SELECT FirstName FROM Customer;
-- INTERSECT returns all entries that are in both queries (without duplicates)

-- names that are employees but not customers
SELECT FirstName FROM Customer
EXCEPT
SELECT FirstName FROM Employee;
-- EXCEPT returns entries that match the first query, and are not matched in the second query
-- ORDER MATTERS!

-- To use a set operation, the queries must return the same type and number of columns.

-- Sub-Query
-- it's sometimes easier to express a complex astwo queries that work sequentially

-- the artist who made the album with the longest title.
SELECT * FROM Artist 
WHERE ArtistID = (
	SELECT ArtistID from Album
	WHERE LEN(Title) >= ALL(SELECT LEN(Title) FROM Album)
);

-- returns all tracks that were never purchased
SELECT * FROM Track WHERE TrackID NOT IN( SELECT TrackID FROM InvoiceLine );
-- Queries operate from the most-nested to the least-nested query 
-- Operators for Subqueries:
-- IN, NOT IN, EXISTS, ANY, ALL 

-- SQL "Families" of the language

-- DQL - Data Query Laanguage - how we pharse/form a query
-- DDL - Data Definiation Language - how we define the database (create a table, define the column of a table)
-- DML - Data ManipulationLanguage - how we manipulate the database (add an entry, how we change an entry or table) 

-- DDL - CREATE, ALTER, DROP

-- Constraints
-- any column can contain NULL, we can restrict that with "NOT NULL"
-- writing "NULL" can make that default explicit

-- PRIMARY KEY
-- automatically implies that a field must not be null, and that it must be unique

-- UNIQUE
-- enforce that every entry must have a different value for this column
-- *GOOD for candidate key
-- *GOOD for representing a 1-1 relationship

-- CHECK
-- CHECK(CONDITION)
-- whenever condition is inside the () must result in true for the entry to be considered valid
-- if the condition tests false, an entry will be required

-- DEFAULT
-- Sets a default value for the column when new data is added.
